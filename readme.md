  Hack n Slash


When you enter a room, a swarm of clansmen appear! They will be one of these roles - 
Bass 
Tenor
Alto
Soprano


They fight you, you fight them. You will probably win most of the time.
When you lose you di


Once the swarm is all killdead: Two drops appear. 
One is a musical element. It adds to your shield. 
The other is a buff. It is a skill boost.


Musical Element: It will be one of the four parts to the shield!
The part that it plays depends on the clan it came from. How loud it is depends on the health of that part.


Select one, the other drop fades away and two doors open: Each leading to a room with a different clan.


Keep fighting until you find all four parts to the same song. Only then do you unlock the Final Door


Buff: It will make you a better person! Faster, or stronger, or luckier. 


Shield: Each of the 4 voices is a shield to attacks (for both player and NPC)
The number of hits it can take correlates to the part of voice.


    Bass > x < Soprano

    Tenor <x x> Alto


When all 4 parts are unified, the soundtrack is assembled and opens the Boss gate.


The volume represents the health of that part.
The type represents the genre.


So if your shield looks like this: 


Bass: 3 health, Trap 
Tenor: 2 health, Techno
Alto: 2 health, Trap
Treble: 3 health, Liquid


then your song will be mostly Trap with the loudest parts being the low bass and high treble notes.
