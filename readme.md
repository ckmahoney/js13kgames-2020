  mechanic is as follows
  The player must complete the first boss with all four parts assembled
  The next boss must be finished with no parts assembld
  The final boss must be finished with all four parts assembled


code notes: 
  player health is represented by the `ensemble: Assemblage`
  if a part is at volume 0, it is dead and the player dies.
  


player attack
  Drops a bomb with burst radius, cooldown is 2s
  ?lazer pickup only


monster attack
  projectile
  burst
  melee
  theft


You (?the player!) may choose one of two types for a gameplay leaning towards one side. 


###  Player Type


!! - Brutal: Driven by melee combat
?? - Strategic: Driven by pickup selection

When you enter a room, a swarm of clansmen appear! 
They fight you, you fight them. You will probably win most of the time.
When you lose you di


Once the swarm is all killdead, two drops appear. 
One is a musical element. It adds to your assemblage. 
The other is a buff. Hope it helps.


Element: It will be one of the four parts to the assemblage!
The part that it plays depends on the clan it came from. How loud it is depends on the strength of that part.


Select one drop, the other drop fades away and two doors open: Each leading to a room with a different clan.


Keep trekking until your assemblage is complete. Then you are set for trial against the first Boss.
Beat the boss
Follow the directions
And beat the next boss with no assemblage.

Once you have proven your skill both with and without your Assemblage, then you may fight the final Boss.

A buff is a boost in skill or other change in game state to the player's benefit.
It is represented by a unique ASCII character. The same character represents the same type of buff on each playthrough.
Buff does affect player width. The more buffs being carried, the more area the player covers.

###  Player buffs

λ - Bloodline, when the completed assemblage is destroyed, collecting a child assembalge of same type is 1.5x stronger
* - Shots, consumable manual burst lazer shots
& - Heatup, lowers the cooldown time for bomb
~ - Luck, stackable for better rolls in player's favor
+! - Safety, lessens damage to AT
+? - Safety, lessens damage to BS
  Monster Buffs

###  Monster Buffs

2 - Two Claw, attacks damage a secondary shield type
. - Curse, next drop is guaranteed to be monster buff


The buff is visibily stored between the player's two identifier characters. 
For example, a Brutalist with Luck, Heatup and Two Claw looks like this

Another example, a Strategist with Shots, Bloodline, and Curse looks like this
